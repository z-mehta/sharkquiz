Along with quality curricular education being imparted to the wards, schools & colleges today are fast recognizing the need for innovative practices & edutaining events to inculcate both, a thirst for General Knowledge that stands one in good stead through school & beyond, as well as the development of Lateral & Out-of-the-box Thinking habits that contribute to the overall development of students.SharkQuiz seeks to be a provider of just such innovative quizzing solutions for schools & colleges who think beyond the ordinary; for whom the holistic development of their students’ intellects matters just as much as their involvement in all subjects like C,C++,HTML etc.</p>
